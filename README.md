### Colors

![Color](/documentation/images/designs/Dean%20Crystal%20Colours.png)


While silver isn't explicitly prominent in the logo, as an accent it can complement the existing palette.

- Text and icons: Use silver for headings, subheadings, and icons to create contrast against the darker primary color.
- Dividers and separators: Employ thin silver lines to separate content sections, creating visual breaks without harsh lines.
- Hover effects: Apply a subtle silver hover effect to buttons or interactive elements, adding a touch of sophistication.
- Background accents: Consider using a subtle silver gradient or pattern for specific sections to add depth without overwhelming the design.

For Text/Icons:

- #C0C0C0 (Classic Silver): A standard, neutral silver.
- #BDBDBD (Slightly Darker): Offers a bit more contrast against the light gray.
- #D3D3D3 (Light Silver): Subtle, good for backgrounds or hover effects.

For Dividers/Subtle Accents:

- #E6E6E6 (Matches your existing light gray): Creates separation without harsh contrast.
- #EEEEEE (Slightly lighter): Very subtle, good for barely-there lines.

For Hover Effects:

- #F2F2F2 (Very Light Silver): Adds a gentle shimmer on interaction.
- #C0C0C0 Use a semi-transparent white with a hint of the classic silver  mixed in for a glowing effect.


To ensure compliance to standards, the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) (also available as extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colour-contrast-checker/nmmjeclfkgjdomacpcflgdkgpphpmnfe)) was used.
<br>
Both the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and the [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) color contrast tools were used to corroborate these results.

### Main Palette

- Primary: Dark blue (#003366)
- Secondary: Light blue (#6699cc), Light gray (#e6e6e6)
- Accent: Silver

	| Heroku Deployment Steps |
</p>

**Steps:**

This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

Creating Repository on GitHub

First make sure you are signed into Github and go to the code institutes template, which can be found here.

Then click on use this template and select Create a new repository from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click Create repository from template.

Once the repository was created, I clicked the green gitpod button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

Creating an app on Heroku

After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to heroku and sign in.

On the home page, click New and Create new app from the drop down.

Give the app a name(this must be unique) and select a region I chose Europe as I am in Europe, Then click Create app.

Create a database

Log into CIdatabase maker.
Add your email address in input field and submit the form.
Open database link in your email.
Paste dabase URL in your DATABASE_URL variable in env.py file and in Heroku config vars.

Deploying to Heroku:

Head back over to heroku and click on your app and then go to the Settings tab
On the settings page scroll down to the config vars section and enter the DATABASE_URL which you will set equal to the elephantSQL URL, create Secret key this can be anything, CLOUDINARY_URL this will be set to your cloudinary url and finally Port which will be set to 8000.

Then scroll to the top and go to the deploy tab and go down to the Deployment method section and select Github and then sign into your account.

Below that in the search for a repository to connect to search box enter the name of your repository that you created on GitHub and click connect.

Once it has been connected scroll down to the Manual Deploy and click Deploy branch when it has deployed you will see a view app button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.
