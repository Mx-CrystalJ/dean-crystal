- Secondary: Light blue (#6699cc), Light gray (#e6e6e6) 
- Accent: 
- Silver
While silver isn't explicitly prominent in the logo, as an accent it can complement the existing palette. 
•	Text and icons: Use silver for headings, subheadings, and icons to create contrast against the darker primary color.
•	Dividers and separators: Employ thin silver lines to separate content sections, creating visual breaks without harsh lines.
•	Hover effects: Apply a subtle silver hover effect to buttons or interactive elements, adding a touch of sophistication.
•	Background accents: Consider using a subtle silver gradient or pattern for specific sections to add depth without overwhelming the design.

For Text/Icons:
•	#C0C0C0 (Classic Silver): A standard, neutral silver.
•	#BDBDBD (Slightly Darker): Offers a bit more contrast against the light gray.
•	#D3D3D3 (Light Silver): Subtle, good for backgrounds or hover effects.
For Dividers/Subtle Accents:
•	#E6E6E6 (Matches your existing light gray): Creates separation without harsh contrast.
•	#EEEEEE (Slightly lighter): Very subtle, good for barely-there lines.
For Hover Effects:
•	#F2F2F2 (Very Light Silver): Adds a gentle shimmer on interaction.
•	Use a semi-transparent white with a hint of the classic silver (#C0C0C0) mixed in for a glowing effect.
